Troubleshooting: If you have problems loading the application, make sure you have the required packages installed which are listed at the top of server.r.  Try updating the listed packages if not using RStudio Version 0.99.447. Make sure you download the GBIF package.  The server.r, ui.r, and all other contents of this folder need to be kept in the same directory.
